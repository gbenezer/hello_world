# HelloWorld

This is a sample package implementing a simple function that returns a string and also prints that string.

The construction of this package used information from the [Cargo Guid](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/index.html) and [the "Writing Automated Tests" Section of The Rust Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-00-testing.html) for constructing the base package files, necessary directories, and using a testing framework.
