# HelloWorld

This is a sample package implementing a main function that prints two lines as well as a function that adds two numbers together. A unit test was generated for the addition function. 

The construction of this package used information and code from the [Cargo Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/index.html) and [the "Writing Automated Tests" Section of The Rust Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-00-testing.html) for constructing the base package files, necessary directories, and using a testing framework.
